European stocks end strong week with mild losses | Reuters(Reuters) - European stocks closed slightly lower on Friday, taking the shine off a 7% rally this week as investors focused on soaring coronavirus cases on the continent and uncertainty around the U.S. presidential election.The pan-European STOXX 600 slipped 0.2% after a five-day winning streak that marked the index’s best week since early June.Sparking a rally in global stocks, investors bet that Democrat Joe Biden will become the next U.S. president but Republicans will retain control of the Senate, potentially delaying major policy changes including tighter scrutiny on big American firms.Wall Street stocks were, however, choppy on Friday as Biden took the lead over President Donald Trump in the battleground states of Pennsylvania and Georgia, putting him on the verge of winning the White House.A handful of states continue to count votes and Trump has falsely claimed the election is being “stolen” from him.“Nagging doubts remain that the eventual outcome may well end up in the U.S. courts,” Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets wrote in a note. “For now, financial markets don’t appear too concerned, however it would still seem prudent to take some money off the table as we head into the weekend.”Meanwhile, Italy registered its highest ever daily coronavirus case tally, with the northern region of Lombardy remaining the hardest hit area.Airline Lufthansa dropped 6.9% as Germany warned against unnecessary travel to Denmark, Italy and several other countries.British airline easyJet fell 2.6% after it said the recently announced lockdowns in England, Germany and France had forced it to further scale back its already reduced flying schedule.“Almost certainly, we could see double-dip recession in parts of Europe,” said Dhaval Joshi, European investment strategist at BCA Research in London.Automakers fell the most, down 1.7% after surging this week on hopes that a Biden win could lead to a softer stance on trade policies.Insurers got a boost after Germany’s Allianz reported an surprise 6% rise in third-quarter net profit.A multi-billion dollar deal involving RSA, Canadian insurer Intact Financial and Danish insurer Tryg also lifted the sector.Miners gained the most, up almost 2% as metals prices rose in the wake of a weakening dollar. [MET/L]Cartier jewellery maker Richemont jumped 8.9% as it saw a marked improvement in the second quarter thanks to online retail sales and China. Swatch Group gained 0.8% in sympathy.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes. See here for a complete list of exchanges and delays.

Explainer: Citizen Trump will face legal woes | ReutersWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Since taking office in January 2017, President Donald Trump has been besieged by civil lawsuits and criminal investigations of his inner circle.With Democrat Joe Biden capturing the presidency on Saturday, according to all major U.S. television networks, Trump’s legal woes are likely to deepen because in January he will lose the protections the U.S. legal system affords to a sitting president, former prosecutors said.Here are some of the lawsuits and criminal probes that may haunt Trump as he leaves office.Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, who enforces New York state laws, has been conducting a criminal investigation into Trump and the Trump Organization for more than two years.The probe originally focused on hush money payments that Trump’s former lawyer and self-described fixer Michael Cohen paid before the 2016 election to two women who said they had sexual encounters with Trump, which the president has denied.Vance, a Democrat, has suggested in recent court filings that his probe is now broader and could focus on bank, tax and insurance fraud, as well as falsification of business records.Republican Trump has called Vance’s case politically motivated harassment.The case has drawn attention because of Vance’s efforts to obtain eight years of Trump’s tax returns. In July, the U.S. Supreme Court, denying Trump’s bid to keep the returns under wraps, said the president was not immune from state criminal probes while in office, but could raise other defenses to Vance’s subpoena.Vance will likely ultimately prevail in obtaining Trump’s financial records, legal experts said.The U.S. Justice Department has said a sitting president cannot be indicted. Vance is not bound by that policy because he is not a federal prosecutor, but he may still have been reluctant to charge Trump because of uncertainty over whether the case was constitutional, said Harry Sandick, a former prosecutor in New York.“Those concerns will disappear when Trump leaves office,” Sandick said.The investigation poses a threat to Trump, said Corey Brettschneider, a professor of political science at Brown University.“The fact that they have issued the subpoenas and have litigated all the way to the Supreme Court suggests that this is a very serious criminal investigation of the president,” Brettschneider said.Trump could conceivably face a criminal prosecution brought by the U.S. Department of Justice, led by a new U.S. Attorney General.Some legal experts have said Trump could face federal income tax evasion charges, pointing to a New York Times report that Trump paid $750 in federal income taxes in both 2016 and 2017.“You’ve got the stuff that has come out of the New York Times that has all kind of indicia of tax fraud,” Nick Akerman, a lawyer at Dorsey & Whitney and a former federal prosecutor.Trump has rejected findings from the Times report, tweeting that he had paid many millions of dollars in taxes but was entitled to depreciation and tax credits.Such a prosecution would be deeply controversial, and the Justice Department could decide charging Trump is not in the public interest even if there is evidence of criminal wrongdoing.Biden has approached that question very carefully, saying he would not interfere with his Justice Department’s judgment.Biden told National Public Radio in August that pursuing criminal charges against his predecessor would be “a very, very unusual thing and probably not very - how can I say it? - good for democracy.”A lawyer for Trump did not return requests for comment.New York’s Attorney General, Letitia James, has an active tax fraud investigation into Trump and his family company, the Trump Organization.The inquiry by James, a Democrat, began after Trump’s former lawyer Cohen told Congress the president inflated asset values to save money on loans and insurance and deflated them to reduce real estate taxes.The Trump Organization has argued the case is politically motivated.The inquiry is a civil investigation, meaning it could result in financial penalties but not jail time.Trump’s son, Eric Trump, an executive vice president for the firm, was deposed in October because of what the attorney general described as his close involvement in one or more transactions being reviewed.E. Jean Carroll, a former Elle magazine writer, sued Trump for defamation in 2019 after the president denied Carroll’s allegation that he raped her in the 1990s in a New York department store and accused her of lying to drum up sales for a book.In August, a state judge allowed the case to go forward, meaning Carroll’s lawyers could seek a DNA sample from Trump to match against a dress she said she wore at the store.A federal judge in Manhattan rejected a bid by the U.S. Justice Department to substitute the federal government for Trump as defendant in the case. U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan said that Trump did not make his statements about Carroll in the scope of his employment as president.Barbara McQuade, a law professor at the University of Michigan, said she expected Biden’s Justice Department to abandon the effort to shield Trump from the case.“It would seem unlikely for DOJ to continue to pursue what I see as a frivolous argument in a new administration,” said McQuade, a former federal prosecutor.Trump also faces a lawsuit by Summer Zervos, a 2005 contestant on Trump’s reality television show “The Apprentice,” who says Trump kissed her against her will at a 2007 meeting and later groped her at a hotel.After Trump called Zervos a liar, she sued him for defamation.Trump said he is immune from the lawsuit because he is president.The case here has been on hold while a New York state appeals court reviewed a March 2019 decision that Trump had to face the case while he is in office. Trump's immunity argument would no longer apply once he is out of office.

Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon banned from Twitter after calling for beheading of FBI director | Science & Tech News | Sky NewsMr Trump's former chief strategist says his remarks about beheading FBI director and COVID-19 expert were "meant metaphorically".Donald Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon has been banned from Twitter after he called for the beheading of Dr Anthony Fauci and the FBI director Christopher Wray.The action comes as Donald Trump supporters - some of them armed with rifles and handguns - descended on election counting centres after the president made unsubstantiated allegations that the vote is being stolen from him.US election 2020 live: Follow the latest updatesMr Bannon, who is currently on bail after pleading not guilty to charges of fraud and money laundering, made the comments during an online show in which he criticised the men for not supporting the president enough.Dr Fauci, who is the head of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has warned that the US government's strategy for tackling COVID-19 needs an "abrupt change".Bannon has previously criticised Mr Wray for allegedly failing to investigate a hard drive allegedly owned by Hunter Biden, Joe Biden's son, the contents of which were leaked to the New York Post in "highly suspicious" circumstances.After initially calling for Dr Fauci and Mr Wray to be fired, Mr Bannon added: "I'd actually like to go back to the old times of Tudor England. I'd put their heads on pikes."I'd put them at the two corners of the White House as a warning to federal bureaucrats. You either get with the program or you're gone."The conversation with his co-host, Jack Maxey, continued with Maxey stating: "Just yesterday there was the anniversary of the hanging of two Tories in Philadelphia."These were Quaker businessmen who had cohabitated, if you will, with the British while they were occupying Philadelphia. These people were hung. This is what we used to do to traitors."Bannon responded: "That's how you won the revolution. No one wants to talk about it. The revolution wasn't some sort of garden party, right? It was a civil war. It was a civil war."Following these comments, Twitter permanently banned the Steve Bannon's War Room account, while YouTube and Facebook also deleted the video, all saying it violated their policies on inciting violence.A spokesperson for Mr Bannon said Mr Bannon "did not, would not and has never called for violence of any kind", adding that his "commentary was clearly meant metaphorically".The former chief strategist had been arrested on a yacht in relation to fundraising for the controversial Mexico border wall earlier this year.The US Department of Justice said the charges relate to We Build The Wall, a fundraising campaign to support the building of a border wall between the US and Mexico.Federal prosecutors alleged that Bannon, along with three others, "orchestrated a scheme to defraud hundreds of thousands of donors" in connection with the online crowdfunding campaign, which raised more than $25m (£19m).The charges against Bannon, 66, and three others, Brian Kolfage, 38, Andrew Badolato, 56, and Timothy Shea, 49, were contained in an indictment unsealed in Manhattan federal court.According to the indictment, Bannon promised that 100% of the money donated would be used for the project, but the defendants allegedly used hundreds of thousands of dollars in a manner inconsistent with the organisation's public representations.They allegedly faked invoices and sham "vendor" arrangements in a bid to hide what was really happening, the indictment added.

US election 2020: Trump sounded defeated and some Republicans now want him out of the party | US News | Sky NewsUnity in the Republican party has has been undermined by the president's denouncing of the country's democratic process. By  James Matthews, news correspondent, in Washington DC  History may call it the death rattle of this presidency. Right now, the election needs to be called first.As the country's verdict crystallised and TV increasingly showed a map turning Democrat blue, Donald Trump addressed journalists inside the White House.US election 2020 live: Follow the latest updatesThe voting figures had formed in him a melancholic mode and he read, low-key, from a paper script through familiar, baseless, accusations of an election "stolen".However, he didn't present so much as president pickpocketed and ready for robust challenge. Rather, the tone was resigned.If this was a set-piece media event to lay out a convincing case for legitimate challenge, it fell short - short of a White House lawyer or two to give detail and credibility on where and why the courts would see fit to become involved.Donald Trump's advisers had reportedly advised him against rolling out his allegations of electoral fraud, but he ignored them.A fraught election can put distance between a president and his people and there's increasing evidence of it.The Republican Party has obediently filed in behind Donald Trump throughout his term, but unity has been undermined by his denouncing of the country's democratic process. The fracture lines stretched onto social media.Maryland's Republican Governor Larry Hogan tweeted: "There is no defence for the President's comments tonight undermining our Democratic process."Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger tweeted: "STOP Spreading debunked misinformation... This is getting insane."Twitter - where else - was the arena for Family Trump to engage in the fight. A series of tweets from Eric and Don Trump Jnr, sons of Donald, screamed at Republicans in an effort to shake them for support.Eric Trump tweeted: "Where are Republicans! Have some backbone. Fight against this fraud. Our voters will never forget you if your (sic) sheep! "Therein lies the dilemma for the Republican party. The "our voters" of whom Eric Trump spoke number nearly 70 million after Tuesday's election.It's a huge voter base that every Republican needs, whether Donald Trump remains in the White House or not.The Trump warning to Republicans is "back him or else".The incumbent president needs the wider support of the movement to add momentum and political clout to any court challenge.Many Republicans would prefer to see Donald Trump recycled out of the party for the party's sake. Enabling such a scenario comes with significant risk to personal and party ambition.Not for the first time with this president, it is a balance of priorities and principles.
